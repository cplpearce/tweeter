##### What:
Tweeter is a personalized platform for hosting your own thoughts!  Post tweets up to 140 characters (but no more than that!), read the tweets of others, and share your [short-links](https://github.com/cplpearce/tinyapp) you've been keeping to yourself!

Included in the app is user input sanitization (no nasty javascipt injects), and error handling for tweet length, or absence of length.

##### Who:
This little app will suit anyone, however I should warn you at this stage this is purely a self-contained application.  When you do tweet, to your millions of followers, sadly only you will be able to read them.

##### How (Dependencies)
This project is created using a mix of Nodejs, Javascript, jquery, html/css, and various other mechanisms for displaying html.  The backend of this app was created by Lighthouse Labs.

To run the app you require:
* Node 5.10.x or above:

To get this running on your local machine running Nodejs, `npm install` the following:

* body-parser: ^1.15.2,
* chance:      ^1.0.2,
* express:     ^4.13.4,
* md5:         ^2.1.0

Or download the app and run `npm i` to get all the packages required - then `npm start`, and finally navigate your browser to `localhost:8080`!
